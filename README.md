### Ideas

I was thinking it could be a chat program powered by google firebase.
I can use this as an opportunity to re-learn java.

### Install

Installing Firebase for java.

First you need SDKMAN!

```curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash```

Now install gradle

```sdk install gradle```

Finally, run the gradle command to install firebase.

```compile "com.google.firebase:firebase-admin:8.1.0"```
